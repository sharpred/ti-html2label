<h2>Absence / Attendance</h2>
<p>The following is an extract from our Attendance Policy to clarify the responsibility of parents and carers. Raising attendance is a key school priority and we will continue to monitor attendance on a weekly basis. We were delighted with the improvements we were able to make last year and can only hope to continue with this trend into the future. Parents/carers are asked to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wrap any authorised days of term time absence (for exceptional circumstances) around existing school holiday periods to minimise time out of school;</li>
<li>Weigh the benefits to the family of term time absences against detriment to the child’s/children’s educational progress and attainment;</li>
<li>Consider whether it is wholly necessary for the child/children to accompany adults in some circumstances;</li>
<li>Avoid requesting term time absences during periods where there are <i>National Curriculum assessments</i> (see Term Dates for information about these);</li>
<li>Attempt to ensure their child attends school regularly in accordance with the signed Home School Partnership agreement;</li>
<li>Notify the school office by phone/letter by 9am on the first day of any unforeseen absence (e.g. sickness/ family emergency), and everyday thereafter.</li>
<li>The full attendance policy is available on our website: <a title="More info" href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">www.example.com</a>.</li>

<p>There are approximately <em>ten million dogs</em> kept in the UK [<a href="http://www.pfma.org.uk/pet-population-2014/" target="_blank">Pet Food Manufacturers' Association (PFMA)</a> 2014].</p>
<p>There are many breeds and types of dog, all varying in size, body shape and personality.</p>
<p>On average, dogs live for around twelve years, <i>but many live for much longer</i>.</p>
<h4>Your duty to care</h4>
<p>Owning and caring for a dog is great fun and immensely rewarding. But it is also a <b>big responsibility</b>. If you own or are responsible for a dog, even on a temporary basis, you are required under the <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/whatwedo/changingthelaw/whatwechanged/animalwelfareact">Animal Welfare Act</a> to care for him/her properly.</p>
<h4>Underlines and strike throughs</h4>
<u>this should be underlined by a single line</u>

<del>This should be struck through also</del>
<s>This should also be struck through</s>
<h4>Understanding dogs' needs</h4>
<p>Dogs have very complex needs so looking after them well can be challenging.</p>
<p>There is no one 'perfect' way to care for all dogs because every dog and every situation is different. It is up to you how you look after your dog, but you must take reasonable steps to ensure that you meet all your dog's needs.</p>

<h2>Pupil Premium Grant</h2>
<p>Pupil Premium funding supports children who have received FSM at any time during the previous six years. At the school we have allocated our Pupil Premium funding with the aim of closing the attainment gap between vulnerable children and their peers. Total number of pupils on roll 239 (Sep 2013) Free School Meals funded children: KS1 26% KS2 15% Total in school 18% Total amount of PPG received for 2013-2014 £52,200 There have been a number of benefits to children, staff and the school including: - 22 children have benefited from dedicated ELSA sessions - Staff training to enable greater understanding and management of children with emotional or behavioural difficulties or educationally vulnerable. - An extra member of staff has been employed as a ‘<em>playleader</em>’ for one hour each day to enable the support of vulnerable children during the unstructured part of the day (break times etc)</p>
<p>The allocated room will be fitted with equipment for ELSA groups and other vulnerable children who may need to be withdrawn <strong>temporarily</strong> from mainstream class. - This has reduced the impact on other children.</p>
<p>Extra LSAs have provided additional groups to address social skills, learning skills and attitudes and basic skills - The school will continue to be able to be totally inclusive and all children will be able to access extra-curricular events despite personal financial constraint or the financial limitations of the school.</p>

<h2>Results and Ofsted</h2>
<p>The school 's latest full Ofsted inspection took place in March 2013. Following their time with us the Ofsted inspectors rated the school as: Requires Improvement Their Main Findings were as follows: Since the last inspection, leaders have successfully improved the pupils' experiences in the Reception class and Key Stage 1. As a result, attainment at the end of Year 2 is rising. The commitment of staff to providing a secure and happy haven for all pupils, whatever their backgorund or need is reflected in the many happy faces seen in school each day. Specialist teaching and after-school clubs enrich learning, especially in art and music, and also contribute well to pupils' enjoyment of school. Pupils are polite and courteous and behave sensibly in most lessons. Most show good concern for the needs of others. Governors are diligent in their monitoring of teaching and learning.
